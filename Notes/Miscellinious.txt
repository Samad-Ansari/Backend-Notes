Employee e1 = ne Employee();

# Shallow Comparison

	(e1 == e2) => check based on the memory address

# Deep Comparision
	(e1.equal(e2))


# Equal & hashcode contract

	1. if two object are equal by ' obj1.equal(obj2) ' then there hashcode be same
	2. two different object may have same hashcode
	3. when hashcode is same then equal method is checked

	when you override the equal method, must override the hashcode method

# Optional 
	Used to represent a value which may or may not present
	it is to to avoid NullPointerException

# Method 
	isPresent(), get(),
