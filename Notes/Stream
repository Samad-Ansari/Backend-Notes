# Stream

	additional package of java 8 called java.util.stream

# Feature
	~ not store element, just convey elements from source through pipeline of certain
	  operation
	~ does not modify its source. 
	~ element of stream visited only once, to revisit same element new stream generated

# Method

	allMatch(); return all element which match the predicate

	anyMatch(): return any element which match the predicate

	static builder(): return builder for a stream

	collect(): 	perform mutual reduction operation on the element of this stream
				using Collector

	collect(supplier, accumulator, combiner): perform mutual reduction operation on the element of this stream

	static concat(): concatination of 

	count(): return count of element

	distinct(): return  of distinct element

	empty(): return empty stream

	filter():	return stream of element matches the predicate

	findAny(): return optional describing of element of stream

	findFirst(): return first element of stream in Optional Object

	forEach(): perform action to each element

	iterate(): return infinite sequential ordered stream

	limit(): element no longer of this size

	map(): return stream by applying function to element of stream

	max(): return max element of stream

	min(): return min element of stream

	of(): return sequential stream containing single element

	peek(): return stream, by providing action on each element / mainly used in debugging

	reduce(): perform reduction on element of stream

	reduce(identity, accumulator, combiner): 
			perform reduction on element of stream using parameter

	sorted(): return element in sorted order

	toArray(): return array containing element using generator function
